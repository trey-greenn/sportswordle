I have this simiple new homepage mock up below, MockUp 1.0.0. We are going to use this as the new general design of the homepage. We are going to take it component by component and will not build out any advanced features yet, only implement the new design framework. Do not build out any advanced features, unless specifcally told to. Also, only build out the component that we directly mention.
 
The goal of this sprint is to redesign our homepage and make it user-centric. I am struggling to come up with the perfect home page for the website, but I know I want the homepage to be fun, education, and asthetically pleasing to look at.

 **Sports News Ticker**: Small feed with trending sports topics that could hint at future puzzles
